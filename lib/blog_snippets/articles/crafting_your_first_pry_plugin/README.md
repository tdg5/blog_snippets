![Pry Plugins][Pry Plugins]

When I was first introduced to the [pry][Pry - RubyGems] gem and the alternative
Ruby [CLI][CLI - Wikipedia] / [REPL][REPL - Wikipedia] experience it provides, I
have to admit, I didn't get it. I didn't understand why `pry` was a better
option than [`irb`][IRB - Wikipedia] or more typically for me, `rails console`.
Sure, Pry's built-in commands like `ls` or `cd` (not to be confused with their
OS shell namesakes) make for a nicer CLI experience, but one could already get
information similar to the `ls` command by evaluating a snippet along the lines
of `target.methods.sort - Object.methods`, and what's not nice about typing that
10x a day?

Luckily for you and I, but not my love of typing `Object.methods`, shortly after
my initial star-crossed introduction to Pry, I changed jobs and found myself in
a dev environment where `pry` (via [`pry-rails`][pry-rails - RubyGems]) was the
de facto `rails console`. And now look at me, thanks in large part to the power
of `binding.pry` and the debugging behavior it offers, I've never looked back.

To that end, in this article, we'll look at the basics of crafting a Pry plugin,
from what constitutes a plugin and why you might want to create one, to the
various hooks and APIs Pry provides for plugin integration. Our focus will be
more on concepts than on code, but never fear! In the next article, we'll put
this knowledge to good use by creating a Pry plugin that customizes Pry with a
custom greeting and can also be used as a sandbox for your future Pry endeavors.
We've got a long way to go to get there though, so let's get started!

This article assumes you have some familiarity with Pry, but if this isn't the
case, worry not, I'll cover some resources for getting started with Pry next
and in the [Additional Resources][ID - Additional Resources] section.

## What is Pry?

For those unfamiliar with Pry, Pry bills itself as

> A powerful alternative to the standard IRB shell for Ruby

Written from scratch with advanced functionality in mind, if IRB was [Star Trek:
The Next Generation's Commander Riker][William Riker - Wikipedia], Pry would be
Riker, after the beard. Sure, IRB will get you through your first season, but
sooner or later an away mission comes along and once you see what Pry is capable
of it's hard to go back.

![Commander William T. Riker][Riker meme]

The full ~~beardth~~ breadth of the awesomeness of Pry is too much to go
into in this article, but the team behind Pry has done a great job of covering
most of what one might want to know over at [pryrepl.org][pryrepl.org].

At a glance, here are just a few of the advantages Pry offers:

- Source code browsing (including core C source with the pry-doc gem)
- Navigation around state (cd, ls and friends)
- Live help system
- Command shell integration (start editors, run git, and rake from within Pry)
- Runtime invocation (use Pry as a developer console or debugger)
- A powerful and flexible command system
- Ability to view and replay history

If a bulleted list isn't enough to convince you, consider also that Pry is
enormously extensible with an ecosystem of fun and powerful plugins contributed
and maintained by the Pry community.

All that said, there's really no substitute for spending a few minutes playing
around in a Pry shell to explore the convenience and utility it offers, so if
you haven't gotten hands-on with Pry already, I would definitely recommend doing
so.

At this point, I'm going to assume you're sold on Pry (if you weren't already),
and move on to the focus of this article, Pry plugins.

### What is a Pry plugin, anyway?

So that we're all starting on the same page, let's begin by defining what
constitutes a Pry plugin. First, here's what the
[Pry wiki][Pry Wiki - Plugins - What is a Plugin?] has to say on the matter:

> A valid Pry plugin is a gem that has the `pry-` prefix (such as the `pry-doc`
> gem). There must also be a `.rb` file of the same name in the `lib/` folder of
> the gem. The functionality provided by a plugin is typically implemented by
> way of the customization and command system APIs.

I think this definition does a fair job of describing the situation, but I have
two gripes with this definition. First, this definition is out-dated and makes
no reference to the various hooks built into Pry for customizing behavior. More
on that later. **Note:** Since the original publication of this article I have
[updated the Pry Wiki's definition to reference Pry's Hooks
API][Pry Wiki - Add reference to Hooks API]. OSS FTW!

Second, though it is convenient that Pry will automatically load plugins that
have a `pry-` prefix, there is nothing preventing a gem without such a prefix
from plugging into and extending Pry. Maybe it is preferable to default to
allowing all the things to be loaded by Pry automatically and, thus, defer which
plugins are actually loaded to Pry and the `.pryrc` file. But, even if that is
the reasoning behind this nomenclature, it seems excessive to suggest that a
plugin without such a prefix is somehow *invalid*, as there is almost certainly
a use-case for a Pry plugin that resists being automatically loaded by Pry. Eh,
I'm probably being overly semantic, so enough of my editorializing.

![Load all the things!][Load all the things meme]

My complaints registered, I submit the following definition for a Pry plugin:

> A Pry plugin is a gem that integrates with Pry, typically by configuring
> environment behavior through Pry's customization API; altering or extending
> Pry's command system; and/or by registering behavior via Pry's system of
> life-cycle and REPL hooks. Plugins named with a `pry-` prefix (e.g. `pry-doc`)
> and including a matching `.rb` file in the plugin's `lib` directory (e.g.
> `pry-doc/lib/pry-doc.rb` will be loaded by Pry automatically unless explicitly
> configured otherwise.

Whew, what a mouthful! And what does it all mean? Let's break it down.

[From a certain point of view][Obi-Wan meme], this definition is made up of
three parts. One part describing how a Pry plugin is composed and what it does:

> A Pry plugin is a gem that integrates with Pry

One part describing how a plugin does its thing:

> A Pry plugin ... integrates with Pry, typically by configuring environment
> behavior through Pry's customization API; altering or extending Pry's command
> system; and/or by registering behavior via Pry's system of life-cycle and REPL
> hooks.

And finally, one part describing one oddly particular facet of Pry convention:

> Plugins named with a `pry-` prefix (e.g. `pry-doc`) and including a matching
> `.rb` file in the plugin's `lib` directory (e.g.  `pry-doc/lib/pry-doc.rb`
> will be loaded by Pry automatically unless explicitly configured otherwise.

Since the first part of the definition is entirely unsatisfying in isolation and
the third part feels somewhat superfluous and arbitrary, let's focus on the meat
of our definition sandwich, which in this case also happens to be made up of
three parts. We'll talk about each of these subjects in more depth later, but
for now here's a little bit of background on each.

Pry's **customization API** is an easy to use API that allows for configuring
many of Pry's internals such as prompts, colors, printers, and more.  Depending
on your particular use-case, the customization API may be everything you need to
build out the functionality desired.

Next up we have Pry's command system. As you may have picked up on already, in
Pry terms, **commands** are the various special commands built into Pry like
`ls` or `whereami` that don't evaluate as Ruby code, but instead enhance the
shell experience in some way. In addition to Pry's built-in commands, many Pry
plugins extend Pry by adding new commands that further enhance and extend the
Pry experience.

Finally, Pry's system of **hooks** allow plugins to register behavior at various
points in Pry's life-cycle and cycle of reading, evaluating, and printing input
and output.

Each of these integration methods can be used in isolation or in combination.
In fact, it is very common for Pry plugins to add new commands **and** hook into
Pry's system of hooks.

Now that we've covered some background on what a Pry plugin is, let's see if we
can find examples of these behaviors in plugins out there in the wild.

#### Pry's wild world of plugins

Pry plugins typically fall into one of a few common categories based on the type of
functionality they provide:

**Debugging tools:**

- pry-byebug ([RubyGems][pry-byebug - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-byebug - GitHub])
- pry-debugger ([RubyGems][pry-debugger - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-debugger - GitHub])
- pry-remote ([RubyGems][pry-remote - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-remote - GitHub])

**Command-line interface (CLI) / Command shell:**

- pry-rails ([RubyGems][pry-rails - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-rails - GitHub])
- pry-macro ([RubyGems][pry-macro - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-macro - GitHub])

**Tweaks and enhancements to Pry itself:**

- pry-coolline ([RubyGems][pry-coolline - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-coolline - GitHub])
- pry-theme ([RubyGems][pry-theme - RubyGems] | [GitHub][pry-theme - GitHub])

These are just a few of the available plugins and even more can be found in the [Pry
Wiki's list of Available Plugins][Pry Wiki - Available Plugins].

The plugins within each category, depending on the functionality provided,
typically integrate with Pry in a similar fashion. For example, `pry-rails` and
`pry-macro` both integrate with Pry by adding new commands to the Pry shell.
Alternatively, `pry-coolline` and `pry-theme` both add commands **and** hook
into the REPL to change the formating of the given input or output.

Finally, tending toward other extremes, Pry's family of debugging tools
integrate with Pry by whatever means necessary to provide the advertised
functionality. For example, `pry-debugger` and `pry-byebug` (a fork of
`pry-debugger`) both intercept calls to `Pry.start` to inject their behavior.
Taking another alternate approach, `pry-remote` adds an entirely different interface
for starting a Pry session, `Object#remote_pry`, that encapsulates the logic to
transform a Pry breakpoint into a fully functional
[Distributed Ruby (DRb)][DRb - Wikibooks] server, ready for a remote client to
connect and begin poking around.

Seeing as the Ruby language facilitates just about any kind of advanced Pry
integration one might want to monkeypatch in, we won't discuss more advanced
means of integrating with Pry. Instead, let's take a look at the facilities
built into Pry specifically for plugin integration.

## Integrating with Pry

As we've uncovered so far, there are three primary mechanisms for Pry plugins to
integrate with Pry: the customization API, Pry commands, and Pry's system of
hooks into the read-eval-print loop and instance life-cycle. Since many of the
configurables exposed by Pry's customization API are intended for manipulation
from a `.pryrc` file and don't require a full-fledged plugin, let's start
there to get a better feeling for what can be accomplished with simple
configuration before considering what is better suited to a more fully-featured
plugin.

### Pry's customization API

Pry's customization API is exposed via a configuration object on the `Pry`
constant, `Pry.config`. The configuration object provides an interface for a
variety of configurations and components that Pry exposes to allow for
customizing Pry in a variety of common ways. Typically, this configuration is
customized from a `.pryrc` file, but it is also available to Pry plugins.
Though the majority of these configurations are shared by all Pry instances, [some
of the configurations can vary between Pry
instances][Pry Wiki - Customization and configuration - Per-instance customization].

Because these configurations vary in complexity and impact, full coverage of
Pry's customization API is best left to the wiki on the matter: [Pry Wiki -
Customization and configuration][Pry Wiki - Customization and configuration].
That said, let's take a quick tour of what the customization API has to offer.

The table below covers the full list of configurables, configuration accessor
names, descriptions, and any applicable defaults. It's worth noting that these
configurations may not be available in all versions of Pry. These configurations
all come from the `0.10.1` version of Pry.

Windows Console Warning  | `windows_console_warning` | Boolean determining whether Windows users should be warned to use `ansicon`. Defaults to `true`.

As you can probably already tell, there's **a lot** you can do with these
configurations. One of my favorite examples of putting these configurations to
"good" use comes in the form of a fun little April fools gag involving
customizing [Pry's
print object][Pry Wiki - Customization and configuration - Print Object].
This custom print object functions similar to Pry's default print object, except
all output will be reversed!

```ruby
Pry.config.print = proc { |out, val| out.puts(val.inspect.reverse) }
```

Another useful configuration to be aware of is [Pry's pager
flag][Pry Wiki - Customization and configuration - Pager]. The pager flag
dictates whether or not Pry will use a pager application when displaying long
output. Though I don't recommend copy-pasta with Pry (seeing as `load`ing a
source file is usually a far superior option), if you do occasionally paste code
snippets into Pry, it can be useful to disable the use of a pager application
since the context switch to the pager application will often wreck havoc on the
paste process. The pager can be disabled like so:

```ruby
Pry.config.pager = false
```

Enabling the pager again is similarly simple:

```ruby
Pry.config.pager = true
```

We'll talk more about Pry commands in the next section, but in the meantime,
here are a couple of simple commands (inspired by the infamous [University
of Florida Taser incident][University of Florida Taser incident - Wikipedia])
that provide a simple example of how the customization API and Pry commands can
be used together. The example commands provide a command interface to enable and
disable Pry's pager functionality. We'll cover other ways of adding commands to
Pry shortly, however for now you could try these commands by adding them to your
`.pryrc` file.

```ruby
Pry.commands.block_command(/don't-page-me-bro/, "Disable pager, bro.") do
  Pry.config.pager = false
end

Pry.commands.block_command(/page-me-bro/, "Enable pager, bro.") do
  Pry.config.pager = true
end
```

That does it for our coverage of Pry's customization API. I definitely encourage
you to explore Pry's many configurations as these customizations can be
pretty handy at times, even if they're not useful for you on a day-to-day basis.
For now though, we move on to Pry's command system.

### Commands and the Pry command system

Pry takes great pride in its command system as one of the things that sets it
apart from other REPLs, and not just because adding new commands to Pry is one
of the easiest ways to add new functionality to Pry. The trick up Pry's sleeve
is that Pry commands aren't methods like they might seem. Rather, they are
special strings that are intercepted by Pry before the input buffer is
evaluated. This approach has a number of advantages:

- Commands can do things that methods cannot do, such as modifying the input
  buffer or using non-standard naming conventions as demonstrated earlier by the
  example `don't-page-me-bro` command.
- Commands can support a much richer argument syntax than normal methods.
- Commands can be invoked in any context since they are local to the Pry
  session. This avoids monkeypatching and/or extending base classes to make
  commands available in any context.

Clever girl!

![Philosoraptor says: Easy, Breezy, Beautiful, Clever Girl][Philosoraptor meme]

Since Pry commands are themselves implemented in Ruby, there's really an
endless array of ways commands can be used to extend and customize Pry.

#### Adding new commands

New commands can be added to the Pry command shell in a variety of ways.

**Create a command directly on the REPLs default command set:**

```{"language": "ruby", "gutter": false}
Pry.commands.block_command("hello", "Say hello to three people") do |x, y, z|
  output.puts "hello there #{x}, #{y}, and #{z}!"
end
```

**Add a class-style command to the current Pry instance's command set:**

```{"language": "ruby", "gutter": false}
Pry::Commands.add_command(PryTheme::Command::PryTheme)`
```

```{"language": "ruby", "gutter": false}
Pry.commands.add_command(PryByebug::NextCommand)`
```

**Import a command set from code:**

```{"language": "ruby", "gutter": false}
Pry.commands.import(PryMacro::Commands)
```

**Import a command set into a Pry session from the REPL:**

```{"language": "ruby", "gutter": false}
pry> import-set PryMacro::Commands
```

Though there are a couple of different variations on how it is achieved, each of
the above examples add commands to Pry's default
[`Pry::CommandSet`][Pry::CommandSet - RubyDoc].

A command set is Pry's mechanism for organizing groups of commands. The default
command set is automatically generated with Pry's built-in commands when Pry is
loaded and can be accessed via `Pry::Commands` or `Pry.commands` (a shortcut to
`Pry.config.commands`, our old friend from the customization API). As the
previous examples demonstrate, the default command set is a frequent target of
Pry plugins, whether to import another command set into the default command set
via the [`Pry::CommandSet#import`][Pry::CommandSet#import - RubyDoc] method, or
to add just a single command via the
[`Pry::CommandSet#add_command`][Pry::CommandSet#add_command - RubyDoc] method.

Although command sets also provide a rich DSL for defining new commands and
adding them to the existing set of commands, as is demonstrated above with
[`Pry::CommandSet#block_command`][Pry::CommandSet#block_command - RubyDoc],
I personally prefer to follow the pattern that Pry itself uses for all of its
built-in commands, which is a more traditional inheritance / class-based
approach that involves subclassing the
[`Pry::ClassCommand`][Pry::ClassCommand - RubyDoc] class.

Defining each command as its own class reduces coupling and makes testing easier
and more flexible by removing extra complexity added by the command set.
Approaching each custom command as its own class also provides flexibility later
on, in that if somewhere down the road you decide that the command should be
added to a command set, you always have the freedom to do so using
[`Pry::CommandSet#add_command`][Pry::CommandSet#add_command - RubyDoc].

We'll look more at `Pry::ClassCommand` and the process of defining a class-style
command in the next article when it's time to build our custom Pry plugin. For
now though, let's take a step back and consider another means of working with
commands that is handy in those situations where the goal is not to add an
entirely new command, but to add behavior around a built-in or otherwise
existing command: command hooks.

#### Command hooks

Before we talk about command hooks, please note that **command hooks are
deprecated** in favor of Pry's hooks API which we'll talk about next.

To facilitate customization and extension of existing or previously defined
commands, Pry includes a couple of methods on each `Pry::CommandSet` instance
that allow for registering hooks that fire before or after the matching command.
This approach is advantageous because it allows for modifying the behavior of a
command in one command set while leaving the behavior of that command unchanged
in another command set.

Aptly named, the methods to hook into the execution cycle of an existing
command, [`Pry::CommandSet#before_command`][Pry::CommandSet#before_command] and
[`Pry::CommandSet#after_command`][Pry::CommandSet#after_command], both take a
matcher that is used to determine which command the hook should be run for. This
can be incredibly useful, but it can also be a little awkward to get the
desired behavior when wrapping the execution of a command at a higher level.

To get a look at these hooks in action, let's consider a simple example of how
we might hook in before the `install-command` command to add some behavior to
track how often various commands are installed into a Pry session.

```ruby
Pry.commands.before_command("install-command") do |command|
  $statsd.increment("pry_command_installation:#{command}")
end
```

In this case I chose to use `Pry::CommandSet#before_command` to watch for
command installation, but this may have undesirable consequences. Because the
hook occurs before the actual command is evaluated, there's no way to know if
the command succeeds or fails. As a result, the above example will track stats
for actual commands that were installed as well as non-existent commands that
will fail to install. As it turns out it doesn't really matter in this case
seeing as the same is true of `Pry::CommandSet#after_command`. Whether or not
the command succeeds or fails, both the `before_command` and `after_command`
hooks will fire receiving only a single argument, nil or the raw String form of
any arguments given to the command invocation.

Though these hooks may seem of limited use, there are definitely situations
where they can be enormously useful, for example, in scenarios where
observer-like behavior is desirable. That said, because of their some what
awkward interface, command hooks are deprecated in favor of Pry's more powerful
hooks API which we cover next.

### Hooks API

As another means of integrating with Pry, Pry offers a number of events that can
be hooked into to register behavior after each Pry instance is initialized or at
various points in the Pry read-eval-print loop. These event hooks follow more of an
event-driven programming style that should feel familiar to anyone who's spent
any time with [`event_machine`][EventMachine - RubyGems] or callbacks in
JavaScript. Though one could certainly argue that Pry commands are also
event-driven to a certain degree, Pry commands are different in that they're
more like defining your own events that fire when certain input conditions are
met. Pry's [hooks API][Pry Wiki - Hooks], on the other hand, offers integration
into some of Pry's deeper internals and most important events.

The events that make up Pry's hooks API fall into two categories, life-cycle
events and REPL events.

#### Life-cycle ~~events~~ event

The `when_started` event is the only life-cycle event and it allows arbitrary code
to be executed whenever a new Pry instance is initialized. In a sense,
the `when_started` event can be thought of as a post-initialization hook allowing
plugins to extend the `Pry#initialize` method with additional logic and behavior.

The arguments given to `when_started` hooks are: the target of the new Pry
instance (E.g. the `binding` in `binding.pry`); the Hash of options given to the
Pry instance at initialization; and finally, the new Pry instance.

`when_started` hooks should be used by plugins that are interested in the
original target object, plugins that are interested in the options given to the
Pry instance, or plugins that wish to take action on a Pry instance immediately
after initialization.

#### REPL events

As one might expect of a REPL, the majority of Pry's events hook into Pry's
read-eval-print loop. Pry has five REPL events. In order of when they tend to
occur they are: `before_session`, `after_read`, `before_eval`, `after_eval`, and
`after_session`.

- The `before_session` event is called whenever we drop into a new REPL CLI session.

- The `after_read` event is called every time a new line of input is read, whether
  or not that line constitutes a complete expression.

- The `before_eval` event is invoked whenever a complete expression is ready for
  evaluation.

- The `after_eval` event is invoked after each complete expression is evaluated.

- The `after_session` event is invoked at the end of each REPL CLI session.

A table summarizing the available events, when they are invoked, and what
arguments are provided to registered hooks can be found below. That said,
before we move on, it's worth discussing the distinction between the
`after_read` and `before_eval` events. The difference is pretty simple, but can
be hard to believe until you see it in action. As stated above, `after_read`
fires after every line of input that is read, while `before_eval` only fires
when a complete expression is ready for evaluation. Consider for example the
following method definition:

```ruby
def standard_example
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

If we were to evaluate this method in a Pry session, imaginary `after_read` and
`before_eval` hooks would fire like so:

```ruby
pry> def standard_example
# :after_read
pry>   puts "Hello, World!"
# :after_read
pry> end
# :after_read
# :before_eval
# :after_eval
```

#### Hooks in action

To get a better feel for when each event is fired, the gif below demonstrates
when each event fires in the context of a Pry CLI session. The gif below also
includes examples of hooks registered via the `before_command` and
`after_command` command hooks we discussed previously. It's worth noting that
the pattern of events below should not be relied upon when crafting Pry plugins.
Plugins like `pry-byebug` that assume control of when Pry is initialized can
cause variations in this pattern, though the variation is mainly related to when
and how often the `when_started` event is fired.

#### Registering hooks

New hooks can be registered with any of Pry's events using the `add_hook` method
of the `Pry.config.hooks` object (an instance of `Pry::Hooks`). For example, a
`when_started` hook could be registered like so:

```ruby
Pry.config.hooks.add_hook(:when_started, "my_hook") do |target, options, pry|
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

Beyond just registering callbacks, the [`Pry::Hooks`][Pry::Hooks - RubyDoc]
class supports a much fuller API for interrogating, manipulating, and defining
hooks and events. This last point is worth making special note of since the use
of custom events allows Pry plugins to expose their own events for other plugins
to integrate with. For example, the `pry-remote` influenced, [`pry-bot`][pry-bot
- GitHub] plugin exposes an `after_print` event for other plugins to integrate
with.

For more information on working with the hooks API or `Pry::Hooks` class,
check out the [Pry Wiki's Hooks page][Pry Wiki - Hooks] or the  [`Pry::Hooks`
docs][Pry::Hooks - RubyDoc].

[`when_started`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - when_started ]    | life-cycle | After `Pry#initialize`                   | The target object, the options Hash, and the new Pry instance
[`before_session`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - before_session] | REPL       | Before each REPL session starts          | The output object, the current binding, and the Pry instance
[`after_read`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - after_read]         | REPL       | After each line of input is read         | The input String and the Pry instance
[`before_eval`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - before_eval]       | REPL       | Before each input statement is evaluated | The code to be evaluated and the Pry instance
[`after_eval`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - after_eval]         | REPL       | After each input statement is evaluated  | The result of the evaluation and the Pry instance
[`after_session`][Pry Wiki - Hooks - after_session]   | REPL       | After each REPL session                  | The output object, the current binding, and the Pry instance

## Next Steps

Well, that does it for our whirlwind tour of Pry plugins.

Stay tuned for the next article where we'll apply a lot of what's covered here
to create a custom greeter plugin for Pry. In the meantime, if you're champing
at the bit and want to exercise your new Pry plugin prowess, take a look at the
list of [Pry Plugin Proposals][Pry Wiki - Plugin Proposals] over at the Pry wiki
for some ideas of where you might get started.

Thanks for reading and good luck Prying!
